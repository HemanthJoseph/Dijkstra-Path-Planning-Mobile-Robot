Download the zip file to a folder of your choice and extract the zip file

In it open the "Dijkstra.py" file in any IDE of your choice, preferably VS Code
Hit the run button in the IDE and the code will prompt you for inputs, give the necessary inputs
If acceptable inputs are given, the code will run and execute the Dijkstra algorithm and generate the shortest path
Once the path is generated, it will plot all the visited nodes and then the path of the travel
You can try for different inputs as required, as long as they are accepted by the program
